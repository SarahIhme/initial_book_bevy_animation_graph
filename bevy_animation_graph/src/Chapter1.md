# Walk-Run Cycle

In this chapter, I will explain how to merge two different animation with each other according to a specified weighting. In addition to this, I will utilize Events on the Event track to make sure that the two animations are timed correctly with respect to a specified action they should sync on like "Right foot down".

We assume you already setup everything for a run animation in the last chapter and that you have a separate walk animation that we can overlay the run animation with. 

## Load and loop your walk animation

## Annotate Right Foot Down action

## Merge those two actions
